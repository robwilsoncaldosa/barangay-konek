# Development Guidelines for Barangay Konek

This comprehensive guide outlines the development standards, conventions, and best practices for the Barangay Konek project.

## Quick Reference

- [Styling & Design System](/docs/development/styling-design-system)
- [React Architecture](/docs/development/react-architecture)
- [File & Folder Conventions](/docs/development/file-folder-conventions)
- [Logic Organization](/docs/development/logic-organization)
- [Rendering Strategy](/docs/development/rendering-strategy)
- [Supabase Integration](/docs/development/supabase-integration)

## Core Principles

### 1. Server-Side First
Prefer **server-side rendering (SSR)** for all features. Use client components only when necessary for interactivity.

### 2. Consistent Styling
All styling must use **CSS variables** defined in `globals.css` through Tailwind utility classes.

### 3. Component Reusability
Always extend **shadcn**'s base UI components to maintain design consistency.

### 4. Clean Architecture
Follow SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic.

### 5. Type Safety
Maintain strict TypeScript usage throughout the codebase.

## Implementation Priority

1. **Server-side rendering and data fetching**
2. **CSS variables via Tailwind utility classes**
3. **shadcn component extensions**
4. **Modular and reusable components**
5. **Client-side interactivity (only when necessary)**

## Key Rules Summary

1. All files and folders → `kebab-case`
2. Components → 1 per file
3. Route-specific components → inside `_components/`
4. All business logic → inside the `server/` folder
5. Check for existing logic before creating new ones
6. Utilities/helpers → `lib/` folder
7. Use only Tailwind utilities with variable-based classes (`text-primary`, `bg-surface`, etc.)
8. No inline, internal, or external CSS
9. Extend shadcn base components for UI
10. Prioritize SSR over CSR
