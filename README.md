## 🌍 Overview

Barangay Konek aims to **digitize barangay operations** by enabling residents to submit, track, and verify their document requests online — while empowering barangay officials to manage approvals efficiently.  
All issued certificates are **blockchain-verified**, ensuring authenticity and transparency across the process.

### 🎯 Core Objectives
- Digitize barangay processes such as clearance, residency, and indigency certificates  
- Provide residents with real-time request tracking  
- Enable blockchain-secured certificate issuance  
- Simplify records management for officials  
- Promote transparency and accountability through open-source technology

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Barangay Konek follows a **Server-Side First Architecture**, ensuring secure data handling and a clear separation between presentation and business logic.

```

app/
├── (resident)/
│   ├── requests/
│   ├── certificates/
│   └── dashboard/
├── (official)/
│   ├── requests/

└── constants.ts

```

### 💡 Design Principles

1. **Server-Side First** — all sensitive logic runs on the server  
2. **Single Responsibility** — one purpose per file  
3. **Strict Type Safety** — every function and schema validated with TypeScript + Zod  
4. **No Inline Styles** — design system only via Tailwind variables  
5. **Reusable UI Components** — built from shadcn/ui foundations  

---

## 🧱 Development Guidelines

To ensure maintainability and consistency across contributors, Barangay Konek enforces the following conventions:

1. **Server logic →** inside `/server`  
2. **UI logic →** inside `/app/(role)/_components`  
3. **Shared utilities →** inside `/lib`  
4. **Always check existing logic** before creating new ones  
5. **Use Tailwind variables** like `text-primary`, `bg-surface`, etc.  
6. **No inline, external, or internal CSS**  
7. **Prefer SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** over CSR
